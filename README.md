# Defender

Defender is a simple application to ward off intruders. Here, we give them a nice warning.

On repeated attempts of breaching our machine, we can further enhance the software to take pictures of the intruders and post them on a social platform. This will probably be the last resort.

p.s we still believe in the goodness of humanity

## Usage

Permissions need to be granted to your terminal since we take preventive actions on intruders that requires elevated accesses.

```sh
./defend
```
